## Version 1.1.0 (Sept 08, 2018)

TL;DR: Improve the way buttons and quickReplies are handled by the webchat.

A button or a quickReply is composed of:

- a title, displayed in the webchat (ex: "Let's the show begin!")
- a value, sent to the Bot Connector when the button is clicked (ex: "RANDOM_BORING_INTERNAL_VALUE")

Previously, the value was sent as a text message, and appeared as such in the webchat as a reply from the user. This mean that when clicking on "Let's the show beging", a user message would appear in the webchat with the content "RANDOM_BORING_INTERNAL_VALUE".

Now, when clicking on a button, both the value and the title are sent. This way, the Bot Connector still receive the value, but the webchat can display the more user-friendly title.

## Version 1.0.0 (Jun 21, 2018)

The first versioned release of the webchat.
